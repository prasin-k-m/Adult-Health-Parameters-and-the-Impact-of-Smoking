# Adult Health Parameters & The Impact of Smoking
## Project Overview

This project explores the **impact of smoking on various adult health parameters** through thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Using a real dataset sourced from Kaggle, the analysis identifies patterns, trends, and health differences between smokers and non-smokers, uncovering insights that can inform public health decisions.

Smoking is widely recognized as a major preventable cause of ill-health and premature death globally, linked to cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, and multiple other health issues.

## Objective

To analyze health indicators such as BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, and more

Compare health parameters between **smokers and non-smokers**

Highlight potential health risks associated with smoking behavior

Provide data-backed **recommendations** for health awareness and preventive action

## Dataset Information

-**Source**: Public dataset from Kaggle

-**Included Data**: Adult demographic and health metrics (height, weight, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, smoking status, etc.)

-**Classification**:

     - 0: Non-smoker

     - 1: Smoker

 Smoking is a major lifestyle risk factor affecting multiple health outcomes. 


## Tools & Libraries

The analysis was conducted using the following Python libraries:

-numpy

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn


These provide the foundation for data manipulation and visualization.

 ## Analysis Workflow

**1. Data Loading & Cleaning**

→ Handling missing values and ensuring consistency

**2. Descriptive Statistics**

→ Summary of health parameters for both smokers and non-smokers

**3. Visualization & Trend Analysis**

→ Histograms, boxplots, distributions, and comparative plots

**4. Health Comparisons**

→ Comparing key metrics such as BMI, blood pressure, heart rate

**5. Interpretation of Results**

→ Identifying patterns and differences linked to smoking status

This workflow ensures a structured and comprehensive exploration of the data.

## Key Insights (Summary)

- Smokers often exhibit **higher health risk indicators** than non-smokers

- Certain physiological measurements like blood pressure and BMI vary significantly when comparing smoking behavior

- The analysis reveals patterns that align with broader research showing detrimental effects of tobacco use on health outcomes. 
  

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

- **Smoking Cessation Programs**
  
Encourage public health initiatives to reduce smoking prevalence.

- **Awareness Campaigns**
  
Use data visualizations to illustrate the impacts of smoking on health outcomes.

- **Preventive Check-ups**
  
Advocate for regular health screenings focused on smokers for early detection of risk factors.

- **Targeted Interventions**
  
Create programs directed at high-risk groups based on age, gender, and smoking metrics.

Including recommendations makes this more than a technical exercise — it highlights real-world applicability.

## Project Presentation

A detailed PowerPoint presentation summarizing the analysis, visual insights, and key findings is included in this repository. It’s crafted to support both technical and non-technical audiences, such as stakeholders, hiring managers, or interview panels.
